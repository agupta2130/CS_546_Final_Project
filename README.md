# Proposal

Stevens CarPool application: The idea here is to provide a facility for Stevens faculty and students to share the ride between them. 

Two entities will be involved here.

  -Driver - He/She can post the ride from a source location to the destination location, ride time, and money for that ride.                    
  -Passenger: He/she can book the ride and pay the amount for that ride using their credit card/ debit card. There will be a full refund if he/she faces any issues during the ride.

Core features: 
  -Set up a profile
  -Search for rides and riders.
  -Find a match
  -Take a ride
  -Pay and review

Extra features:
  -We can add music as per passengerâ€™s interest.
  -Feedback from passengers after every ride.

Advantages:
  -It is safe for passengers.
  -Save time and money both.
  -Good way to reduce carbon.
  -Can make friends during the ride and discuss topics of various interests.
  
Disadvantages:
  -Sometimes passengers have to wait for the ride to start.
